Code Connect is a social media platform for IT professionals. It was created to address the lack of specific features for IT professionals on existing social media platforms. Code Connect offers a dedicated space for IT professionals to connect, collaborate, and access valuable resources.
\section{Problem Statement}

There are many general social media platforms available, but none of them are specifically designed for IT professionals. This means that IT professionals often have to use general platforms, which can be less effective for networking and collaboration.
Most general social media platforms do not have dedicated spaces for IT professionals to share their resumes. This can make it difficult for IT professionals to get their resumes seen by potential employers.
There are no specific resume management tools available for IT professionals. This means that IT professionals often have to use general resume management tools, which can be less effective for managing IT-related resumes.

There is no specific portfolio management tool available for IT professionals. This means that IT professionals often have to use general portfolio management tools, which can be less effective for managing IT-related portfolios.
IT professionals are often underrepresented in other social media platforms. This can make it difficult for IT professionals to reach a wider audience and connect with other IT professionals.
The challenges listed above can be even more difficult for new aspiring IT professionals. This is because new IT professionals may not have the same level of experience or connections as more experienced IT professionals.
