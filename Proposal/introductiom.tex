\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
Code Connect is a social media platform for IT professionals. It was created to address the lack of specific features for IT professionals on existing social media platforms. Code Connect offers a dedicated space for IT professionals to connect, collaborate, and access valuable resources.\\
Here are some of the features that make Code Connect unique:\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Targeted networking: Users can create detailed profiles that highlight their specific IT skills, areas of expertise, and projects they have worked on. This information facilitates the discovery of other professionals with similar interests or complementary skill sets.
    \item Knowledge sharing: Code Connect provides a user-friendly interface where professionals can share their ideas, projects, and solutions. Users can post updates, articles, or tutorials related to their work, thereby contributing to a growing repository of knowledge within the community.
    \item Customization: Users can personalize their profiles, select coding-related badges or icons, and customize privacy settings to suit their preferences. Integration with popular coding platforms and version control systems allows users to showcase their work and demonstrate their expertise.
    \item Community: Code Connect goes beyond the typical social media experience by fostering a sense of community among its users. The platform includes discussion forums, interest-based groups, and event listings where IT professionals can interact, participate in relevant discussions, and even organize local meetups or online webinars.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Motivation}


 Code Connect encourages users to share their ideas, projects, and solutions with the community. The app provides a user-friendly interface that allows programmers to easily post updates, articles, or tutorials related to their work. This helps in creating an environment where users can engage in constructive discussions, seek feedback, and showcase their expertise. Additionally, users can explore a curated feed of programming-related content to stay updated on the latest trends, technologies, and industry news.
\subsection{Problem Statement}


There are many general social media platforms available, but none of them are specifically designed for IT professionals. This means that IT professionals often have to use general platforms, which can be less effective for networking and collaboration.
Most general social media platforms do not have dedicated spaces for IT professionals to share their resumes. This can make it difficult for IT professionals to get their resumes seen by potential employers.
There are no specific resume management tools available for IT professionals. This means that IT professionals often have to use general resume management tools, which can be less effective for managing IT-related resumes.\\\\
There is no specific portfolio management tool available for IT professionals. This means that IT professionals often have to use general portfolio management tools, which can be less effective for managing IT-related portfolios.
IT professionals are often underrepresented in other social media platforms. This can make it difficult for IT professionals to reach a wider audience and connect with other IT professionals.
The challenges listed above can be even more difficult for new aspiring IT professionals. This is because new IT professionals may not have the same level of experience or connections as more experienced IT professionals.\\
